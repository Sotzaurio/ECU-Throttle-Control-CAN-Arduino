# ECU-Throttle-Control-CAN-Arduino
Educational simulation of an automotive ECU implementing electronic throttle control using Arduino and CAN bus. The system uses a distributed architecture with a control node handling throttle input, driving modes (ECO/SPORT), and sensor acquisition, and a display node receiving CAN messages to visualize system status.
